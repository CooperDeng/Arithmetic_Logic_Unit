# Arithmetic_Logic_Unit
Multiplexers, logic adders, 4bit full adders, and love!

Created by Chengfeng Deng, last modified at March 15, 2022.

This is the realization of a circuit that is consisted of hex muxes, a logic adder, a 4-bit full adder and another 5 bit multiplexer.

The Circuit Diagram was provided by the department of electrical and computer engineering, course group ECE-124 Digital Circuit and Systems.

The rest of the file were created and tested by the collaboration of Chengfeng Deng and Tasviq Hossain, from the ECE 2026 of the University of Waterloo.

Files that are provided in this project are being used with no intention of profit, this is only an exhibit of my personal coding skill.

Enjoy!
